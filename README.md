# NestJS Multi-ORM Support

## Overview

NestJS Multi-ORM Support is a flexible module that integrates multiple Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) libraries, specifically TypeORM and MikroORM, into the NestJS framework. This allows developers to use either ORM as per their project needs or even both in the same project.

## Features

**Dual ORM Integration**: Seamlessly use TypeORM and MikroORM within a single NestJS project.
**Configurable**: Easy configuration settings for each ORM.
**Repository Pattern**: Leverage the repository pattern to abstract database operations.
**Decorators**: Custom decorators for easy injection of ORM repositories.

## Installation

Install the NestJs Multi ORM using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install @nestjs-multi-orm
# or
yarn add @nestjs-multi-orm
```
